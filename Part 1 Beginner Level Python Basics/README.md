## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- No prior programming experience required
- Basic computer literacy
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system

### Running the Code
```bash
# Navigate to the beginner level directory
cd "Part 1 Beginner Level Python Basics"

# Run the beginner examples
python Beginner.py
```

## 📝 Detailed Topics

### 1. Python Installation & Setup
Learn how to install Python and set up your development environment.

**Key Points:**
- Download Python from python.org
- Choose an IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter)
- Verify installation
- Set up your first Python project

**Example:**
```python
import sys
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")
```

### 2. Basic Syntax & Structure
Understand Python's unique syntax and structure.

**Key Points:**
- Indentation instead of curly braces
- Comments and docstrings
- Code blocks and structure

**Example:**
```python
# Your first Python program
print("Hello, World!")

if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2")
    print("This line is also indented")
```

### 3. Variables & Data Types
Learn how to store and work with different types of data.

**Key Points:**
- Dynamic typing
- String, integer, float, boolean types
- Type conversion
- Variable naming conventions

**Example:**
```python
# String variables
name = "Noman"
city = "Dhaka"

# Numeric variables
age = 25
height = 5.8

# Boolean variables
is_student = True

# Check data types
print(f"Type of name: {type(name)}")
print(f"Type of age: {type(age)}")
```

### 4. Operators
Master different types of operators for calculations and comparisons.

**Key Points:**
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)

**Example:**
```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")
print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {a / b}")
print(f"Modulus: {a} % {b} = {a % b}")
print(f"Comparison: {a} > {b} = {a > b}")
```

### 5. Control Flow - Conditional Statements
Learn to make decisions in your programs.

**Key Points:**
- if, elif, else statements
- Nested conditions
- Logical conditions
- Truthy and falsy values

**Example:**
```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Good!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Satisfactory")
else:
    print("Needs improvement")
```

### 6. Loops
Understand how to repeat actions efficiently.

**Key Points:**
- for loops with range()
- while loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Nested loops

**Example:**
```python
# for loop
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# while loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"While loop iteration: {count + 1}")
    count += 1
```

### 7. Functions
Create reusable blocks of code.

**Key Points:**
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Default parameters
- Lambda functions

**Example:**
```python
def greet(name, title="Mr."):
    """Greet with optional title."""
    return f"Hello, {title} {name}!"

# Using functions
print(greet("Noman"))
print(greet("Sarah", "Ms."))
```

### 8. Built-in Data Structures
Work with Python's powerful data structures.

**Key Points:**
- Lists: ordered, mutable collections
- Tuples: ordered, immutable collections
- Sets: unordered collections of unique elements
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs

**Example:**
```python
# Lists
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
fruits.append('mango')

# Tuples
days = ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday')

# Sets
colors = {'red', 'green', 'blue', 'red'}  # Duplicates removed

# Dictionaries
student = {'name': 'Noman', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Dhaka'}
```

### 9. String Manipulation
Process and format text data.

**Key Points:**
- String methods (upper, lower, strip, split, join)
- String slicing and indexing
- String formatting (f-strings, format method)
- String validation

**Example:**
```python
text = "  Hello World!  "
print(f"Original: '{text}'")
print(f"Stripped: '{text.strip()}'")
print(f"Upper: '{text.upper()}'")

# String formatting
name = "Noman"
age = 25
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)
```

### 10. Input and Output
Interact with users and display information.

**Key Points:**
- input() function for user input
- print() function for output
- Formatted output
- Input validation

**Example:**
```python
# Getting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

### 11. Basic Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully in your programs.

**Key Points:**
- try-except blocks
- Different exception types
- finally blocks
- Custom error messages

**Example:**
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### 12. Basic File Operations
Read from and write to files.

**Key Points:**
- File opening modes (r, w, a)
- Reading file content
- Writing to files
- File context managers

**Example:**
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!\n")
    file.write("This is a sample file.")

# Reading from a file
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### 13. Basic Math Operations
Perform mathematical calculations.

**Key Points:**
- Built-in math functions
- Math module
- Trigonometric functions
- Rounding and absolute values

**Example:**
```python
import math

print(f"Square root of 16: {math.sqrt(16)}")
print(f"Power of 2^3: {math.pow(2, 3)}")
print(f"Absolute value of -5: {abs(-5)}")
print(f"Round 3.7: {round(3.7)}")
```
